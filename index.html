        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Komal Jat, a passionate teacher with a B.ed degree from RNT College Udaipur. I completed my schooling from a government school, which instilled in me the values of hard work and dedication. I have gained valuable experience in the field through a 6-month teacher training program. Teaching is not just a profession for me; it's a way to make a positive impact on the lives of young learners. I believe in creating a nurturing and inclusive environment where every student can thrive.</p>
